Removing Spaces

 - Create page breaks between all 21 branches (will have to do manually in Word. Not compatible with Text Editors without Javascript)
 x Remove Extra spaces between events (double spaces)
 x Match all days of week, remove. Remove "others"
 - Find ====children==== replace: Children
 - formatting things with macros

Regular Expressions Use Regex (in Atom for now)

To match all instances of ""==Monday== ==Tuesday= =Thursday= =Wednesday=", but not ======childrens===========, ==Could not place. Missing Date and Time information== This is good -helps MarComm to red-penning.
FIND ^==\w+[day]==
REPLACE  \n

Need to find/replace for ==Others==, does not fall within day of week match.
FIND ==Others==
REPLACE \n 

# Remove Double line break, replace with single line break
Find and Replace
Find      (\r\n\s*$){2,}
Replace   \n
